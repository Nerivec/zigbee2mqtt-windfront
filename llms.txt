# Zigbee2MQTT WindFront

> A React + TypeScript frontend UI for Zigbee2MQTT, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, and daisyUI, providing real-time device control and monitoring via WebSocket.

This repository is a monolithic frontend with feature/page component boundaries. It supports multi-instance setups via `sourceIdx` throughout state and WebSocket flows. Routing uses React Router with hash-based navigation, and internationalization is handled with `react-i18next` JSON namespaces.
